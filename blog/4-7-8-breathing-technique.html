                    <h2>How the 4-7-8 Breathing Technique Works</h2>
                    <p>The 4-7-8 technique works by <strong>activating your parasympathetic nervous system</strong> – your body's "rest and digest" mode. This helps counteract the stress response and promotes a state of calm.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Scientific Benefits</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Improved sleep quality:</strong> Research shows deep breathing can reduce the time it takes to fall asleep</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced anxiety:</strong> The extended exhale helps activate the vagus nerve</li>
                        <li><strong>Lower blood pressure:</strong> Regular practice may help reduce hypertension</li>
                        <li><strong>Better stress management:</strong> Provides a tool for managing acute stress responses</li>
